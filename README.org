** lc
A fast and simple "line" count program inspired by FreeBSD's wc.

** Why?
FreeBSD and NetBSD's =wc= is slightly slow. Especially
the word count feature. Both of these implementations
don't check whether it's necessary to convert a character
to a wide character or not. This conversion isn't cheap
and each call for each character takes quite some time.

This implementation isn't conforming to POSIX standards,
rather it's a different implementation. For example,
=lc= doesn't have line length feature (=-L=), mainly
because I found it practically redundant and only in rare
cases it's being used.
